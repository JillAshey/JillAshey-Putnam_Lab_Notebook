## Goal: create and execute histology protocol

#### Materials and Equipment 
- 50 mL falcon tubes 
- 500 mL containers 
- Zinc formalin fixative 
- Ethanol
- Vaccum pump
- Glass bottles
- Plastic jugs and bins
- Personal Protective Equipment 

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Select and record plug ID of corals to be fixed

Randomly choose a sample from each tank, and record the plug ID of the sample. Note how large the coral is -- this will determine what type of vessel (falcon tube or container) it will be put in for fixation.

##### 2) Calculate total volume based on number of samples and types of vessels you need to fix with. 

40 mL per sample for falcon tubes; 400 mL per sample for containers 

##### 3) Filter seawater for fixative solution 

Choose a 0.2 Î¼m filter. Set up the vaccum filter housing: water will be poured into the top, vaccummed through the filter, and deposited in the bottom container. 

Attach the hosing of the vaccum pump to the bottom container of the vaccum filter housing. Once hosing is secure, turn pump on and check dials to make sure there's enough pressure. 

When bottom container is full (~1 L), turn off the pump, wait for pressure to get to 0, and slowly remove hosing from filter housing. Pour the now-filtered seawater into a glass bottle. Repeat until enough is made for fixative.
