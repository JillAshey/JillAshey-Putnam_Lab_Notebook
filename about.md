### Education
2020 - present
PhD student, Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Rhode Island

2016 - 2019
The College of William and Mary; B.S. Biology, magna cum laude with Honors in Biological Research

### Professional Experience

**Ocean Acidification Intern | 2019**
Dr. Emily Hall, Mote Marine Laboratory
- Designed and maintained experiments on coral physiology in relation to ocean
acidification, temperature, and nutrient concentrations; gained experience with
coral husbandry
- Used various lab and field techniques to analyze carbonate chemistry, water quality, and coral physiology

**Research Technician / Volunteer | 2019**
Dr. Emily Rivest, Virginia Institute of Marine Science
- Assisted with set-up and maintenance of aquarium system during experiments
with oyster larvae; gained experience with larval husbandry and analysis in
hatchery setting
- Analyzed carbonate chemistry of tanks in aquarium system

**Undergraduate Honors Researcher | 2017-2019**
Dr. Emily Rivest, Virginia Institute of Marine Science
- Developed and implemented independent research questions regarding how
environmental history impacts the physiological ability of oysters (Crassostrea
virginica) to respond to stress.
- Analyzed carbonate chemistry of water samples and performed assays on oyster
tissue samples.

**NSF Undergraduate Research Fellow (REU) | Summer 2018**
Dr. Emily Rivest, Virginia Institute of Marine Science
- Investigated how the environmental history of juvenile oysters (Crassostrea
virginica) influenced their physiology and growth
- Used various field, lab, and molecular techniques to assess water and tissue
samples.
- Engaged local high school students in my field work to teach them about oysters
and their local watershed.


### Outreach and Teaching Experience

**Teaching Assistant for Animal Physiology Laboratory | Spring 2019**
Dr. Paul Heideman, William & Mary Biology Department
- Communicate new physiological concepts and lab techniques to undergraduate students
- Facilitate the set-up and break-down of lab

**Visiting Elementary School Instructor | 2018 - 2019**
Flemington, NJ
- Presented topics in marine science (ocean acidification, climate change, oysters)
to 3rd and 4th graders through presentations, games, and activities.
